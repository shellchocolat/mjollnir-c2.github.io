# mjollnir c2

**Mjollnir c2** is a **Command and Control** coded in **rust** (backend) and in **vuejs** (frontend).

This c2 will definitely help you out in the **post exploitation** of your **intrusion test**.

Concerning the agent, its name is a **Chocolate**. You can code your own Chocolate in the language you want, and integrate it into Mjollnir very easily. **There is a support to help you with that !**

This is also true, for the listeners. Currently, listeners are coded in **python**, but you can choose the language you want as well.

Each implemented Chocolate is **fully indetectable** and bypass any antivirus solution.

You can define a set of actions for all new registered chocolate. But you can also propagate a bunch of actions to a whole group of chocolate. **In that way, you can add persistance, dump lsass, and so on very easily for a whole group of agent !**

Let's give it a try !
